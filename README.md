* `@stdlib/utils/map`: Maps functions over arrays for signal generation

## Implementation Details

## AM Modulation

The AM modulation implementation uses a sinusoidal
message signal modulated onto a carrier with configurable modulation
index. The demodulation process uses half-wave rectification followed by
 envelope detection with a moving mean and a 2nd-order Butterworth
filter.

## FM Modulation

The FM modulation varies the frequency of the carrier
signal proportionally to the message signal. The implementation includes
 integration of the message signal to calculate phase deviation.
Demodulation uses differentiation, bandpass filtering, and moving mean
for envelope detection.

## Signal Processing

* Modulation parameters (carrier frequency, message frequency, modulation index) are configurable
* Sampling rate and duration are optimized for clear visualization
* FFT analysis shows the frequency spectrum with appropriate scaling
